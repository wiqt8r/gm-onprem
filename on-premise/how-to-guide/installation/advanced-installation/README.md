# Advanced installation

This section provides advanced installation methods for the Navixy On-Premise platform.

We recommend that you use the instructions in this section if you have specific installation requirements, such as deploying a dedicated database server or installing Navixy Platform on a Windows Server.

Choose the instructions depending on your specific tasks:

* [Ubuntu installation](ubuntu-20/) - wizard-guided installation for one or two servers, designed for Ubuntu.
* [Windows installation](windows-installation/) - automated and manual installation for Windows servers.

{% hint style="info" %}
The advanced installation methods with a dedicated database server are recommended for big instances with over 5000 tracked assets. For smaller instances, [Easy Installation](../easy-installation.md) is recommended.
