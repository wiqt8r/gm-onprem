# Nominatim

Nominatim is a free software tool that offers forward geocoding, allowing users to search for locations by name or address, and reverse geocoding, retrieving the postal address or place name by known coordinates.

One of the main advantages of using Nominatim with Navixy On-premise is that it can be deployed on your local server, enabling you to process an unlimited number of requests without any limits. While other geocoding sources can be used in parallel, such as Google, they can be expensive or may not meet your needs in specific regions.

Nominatim is developed as part of the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project and is distributed under an open license, with its source code under the GPLv2. The hardware requirements for Nominatim will depend heavily on the amount of data you plan to maintain. For instance, installing data only for one country or one continent requires fewer resources than the entire globe.

To download Nominatim, simply visit its official web page at [https://nominatim.org/](https://nominatim.org/) .
