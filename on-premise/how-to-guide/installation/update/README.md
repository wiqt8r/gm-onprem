## Update delivery

Navixy On-Premise platform version is updated several times per year, and software updates are included in the subscription fee. This gives administrators the option of upgrading to the latest version of Navixy or continuing to use the version currently installed.

The platform is not kept constantly up-to-date and does not receive the updates automatically. At the same time, customers can receive a new version of the platform on demand from Navixy technical support. Additionally, the latest build of the platform is always available for download at the direct link:
