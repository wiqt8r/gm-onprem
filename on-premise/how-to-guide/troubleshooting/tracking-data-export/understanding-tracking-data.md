# Understanding tracking data

The `tracking` database stores the data in a fairly technical way necessary for the Navixy platform to work. This page will show you how to read the values stored in this database to understand what they mean. This can be useful if you have exported tracking data from the database for some further analysis.

Here we will describe the data contained in each column.

### ID

Unique point identifier.

### Track ID

The value required to identify valid tracks, parkings, and points not involved in tracking:

* Positive value - track point. Repeated value defines points belonging to the same track.
* 0 - parking.
* Negative value - a point that does not participate in the track formation:
  * -1 = invalid point (typically zero coordinates)
  * -2 = invalid time
  * -3 = surrogate point created by the server to save the event recorded for the device.
  * -4 = redundant point that does not change the track geometry.

### Server time

Labeled as `actual_time` in the database. The time when the point was received and saved on the server.

### Tracker time

Labeled as `get_time` in the database. The time at which the point was recorded by device. This timestamp may be significantly different from the server time, for example, when data is buffered on the device due to lack of connectivity.

### Longitude, Latitude, Speed, Altitude

The names of the columns speak for themselves. Point coordinates, movement speed and altitude reported by device.

### Satellites

Number of satellites by which GPS coordinates are determined. In the absence of satellites, points are generally recognized as invalid.

### Status

Tecnical value - the point status on the platform. For more information expand the collapsible panel below.

### Duration

Duration of the event.

### Mileage

Hardware mileage reported by device. May be different from the mileage calculated by the platform depending on the device settings.

### Inputs and Outputs

Input and output states (on/off). Depend on the number of supported inputs and outputs for the device.

{% hint style="info" %}
The value must be converted to binary form and read from right to left. For example, the value of `9` for inputs equals `1001` in binary, and it means the inputs #1 and #4 are on, inputs #2 and #4 are off.
{% endhint %}

### Address

The point address resolved by geocoder according to the coordinates.
