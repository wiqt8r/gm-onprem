# Monitoring

One of the essential aspects of owning a server is the need to monitor and maintain its stability. Early detection of problems can help you respond faster to prevent massive downtime and maintain uninterrupted tracking data acquisition, making your customers happier and increasing profitability.

To keep your server performing at its best, it is important to monitor several performance indicators. The first thing to take care of is client access to the tracking data, which mainly implies accessibility of the website and API. You can also track the availability of services and ports. The advanced approach can include hardware statistics such as CPU usage, average loads, RAM usage, disk space, and disk health.

In this section, we will provide a brief overview of several tools that we and our clients use for monitoring. These tools can help you effectively monitor your server's performance and ensure that it is running efficiently.

* [UptimeRobot](uptimerobot.md)
* [Uptime Kuma](uptime-kuma.md)
* [Zabbix](zabbix.md)

We highly recommend using multiple tools simultaneously, such as UptimeRobot and Zabbix, as this gives you the most control. One can serve external customers, while the other can be a powerful engine for internal work.

While the tools described in this section are our favorites, there are plenty of other services available online to choose from. If you need assistance setting up any of the services listed above, we would be glad to help you. Please contact your Navixy account manager for more details and requirements.
