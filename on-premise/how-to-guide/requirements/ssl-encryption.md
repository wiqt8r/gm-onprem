# SSL encryption

SSL encryption is a vital security measure to protect the web traffic between your customers and your server from malicious interception. This technology safeguards sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals, particularly man-in-the-middle attackers.

To enable SSL encryption, you will need a valid SSL certificate for your domain that is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). It is also essential to note that due to iOS security policy, the X-GPS Monitor for iOS app requires SSL encryption; otherwise, it won't work.

### Choosing SSL provider

Several companies act as certificate authorities that provide SSL certificates, including both paid and free options:

* Paid options usually follow stricter encryption rules, while free alternatives offer adequate protection. Some of the popular paid CA examples include [Comodo](https://ssl.comodoca.com/), [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/web-security/ssl-certificate), [DigiCert](https://www.digicert.com/), and [RapidSSL](https://www.rapidssl.com/).
* Popular free CA option: [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

### Domains to secure

Typically, three domains are used in working with Navixy, such as:

* [my.domain.com](http://my.domain.com) – for user web interface
* [panel.domain.com](http://panel.domain.com) – for Admin panel
* [api.domain.com](http://api.domain.com) – for API calls

You have several options to use SSL encryption for your domains, such as issuing a wildcard certificate for all subdomains **\*.domain.com**, separate certificates for each subdomain, or a multi-domain certificate that includes all three domains.

It is important to take note of the expiration date of your certificate, particularly when using a free certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). This certificate has a fixed expiration date of three months, requiring manual updates or automatic updates setup. Also, ensure that the certificate contains a full chain of trust, including root and intermediate certificates, or features such as Navixy iOS monitoring app may not work.

After obtaining the SSL certificates, you need to install them, and you can refer to Navixy's simplified how-to instruction for certificate installation. CA support is available if you have questions regarding the certificate issuance process.
