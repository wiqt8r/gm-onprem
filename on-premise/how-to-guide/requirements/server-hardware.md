# Server hardware

The hardware requirements for Navixy primarily depend on the number of active IoT devices (GPS trackers) that are connected to the platform. Navixy's setup is scalable both vertically and horizontally, and the platform has been tested to support more than 300,000 active devices and 50,000 users simultaneously.

## Scalability

ï»¿Scalability should always be considered. Successful businesses tend to grow, and as the number of connected devices increases, so does the consumption of server resources. It should be foreseen to increase server resources in all aspects - disk space, RAM and processor capacity. The configurations listed in the table below are recommended and will ensure stable operation of the platform, but as resource consumption increases, these configurations may become inapplicable, and it will be necessary to expand the server capabilities.

## Storage

In a highly loaded system, one of the key factors for fast performance is disk speed. If you are deploying a new server, it is highly recommended that you use SSD to host the database. Using HDD is a bottle neck for the speed of large databases when running big queries.

The disk space requirements in the table below are approximate. The actual space consumption depends on the number of devices and how often they transfer data to the server. Data from a stationary object that transmits information once a day and data from an actively moving vehicle take up dramatically different amounts of space.

## RAM

The RAM values shown in the table below are averages. Actual RAM consumption depends on how many devices are online at the same time and how much data they send. Memory may also be consumed by additional services installed on the server for any purposes. In addition, Windows servers usually consume more RAM due to the fact that they have more processes running in the background.
