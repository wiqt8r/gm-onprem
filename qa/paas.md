# PaaS

Navixy PaaS (Platform as a Service) is a cloud-based platform that provides a comprehensive set of tools for GPS tracking and telematics applications. It is designed to enable businesses to build and deploy their own GPS tracking systems and telematics applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure or worry about software updates, maintenance, and security.

## Launching Navixy PaaS instance

To create Navixy PaaS instance, login to the [Customer portal](https://portal.navixy.com/) and click "Create product" button. In the dialog, you will be prompted to create your instance of the Navixy platform.
