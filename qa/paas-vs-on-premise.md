# PaaS vs. On-Premise

Each of the two Navixy deployment options has its advantages, so choosing the one that best suits your project depends on your specific requirements:

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="171.272705078125"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Deployment</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td><a href="paas.md">PaaS</a></td><td>PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) deployment is the most popular option that provides hassle-free, scalable solution. With PaaS deployment, the software is hosted on Navixy's global cloud infrastructure. Customers don't have to worry about server maintenance or upgrades, and always get the most up-to-date software version. This option is ideal for businesses that need to quickly scale their operations or don't have the resources to maintain their own servers.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="../on-premise/how-to-guide/">On-premise</a></td><td>On-Premise deployment is the most flexible option, as it allows customers to install Navixy on their own physical or cloud servers. With On-Premise deployment, customers have full control over their server hardware and software, and can customize the system to meet their specific requirements. This deployment option is well-suited for businesses that require complete control over their Navixy system, have unique customization needs, or enforce strict data security policies.</td></tr></tbody></table>
